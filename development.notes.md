### For local development below needs to be done.
  - Update the package.json start from `node server.js` to `ng server`
  - mostly if the application is running in local use `http://localhost:8080/` in the environment.json

 - To test the deployment locally use `ng build` and then use `node server.js` before deploying to heroku.
